# Musica

This is a sandbox allowing me to combine my love of coding with my education in music theory for guitar :guitar:. The module is typed, and uses `pygame` to play the notes within a scale.

## CyclicList Class

Included is the `CyclicList` class which provides an iterable with infinite recursion useful for assembling chords and scales.
